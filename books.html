						Why do our headaches persist after we take a one-cent aspirin but disappear when we take a fifty-cent aspirin?<br>
						Why do we splurge on a lavish meal but cut coupons to save twenty-five cents on a can of soup?
						When it comes to making decisions in our lives, we think we're making smart, rational choices. But are we?<br>
						In this newly revised and expanded edition of the groundbreaking New York Times bestseller, <br>
						Dan Ariely refutes the common assumption that we behave in fundamentally rational ways.<br>
						From drinking coffee to losing weight, from buying a car to choosing a romantic partner,
						we consistently overpay, underestimate, and procrastinate.<br> Yet these misguided behaviors are neither random nor senseless.<br>
						They're systematic and predictable—making us predictably irrational.<br><br><br>

						Intelligent algorithms are already well on their way to making white collar jobs obsolete:<br>
						travel agents, data-analysts, and paralegals are currently in the firing line.<br>
						In the near future, doctors, taxi-drivers and ironically even computer programmers are poised to be replaced by 'robots'.<br>
						Without a radical reassessment of our economic and political structures, we risk the very implosion of the capitalist economy itself.<br>
						In Rise of the Robots, technology expert Martin Ford systematically outlines <br>
						the achievements of artificial intelligence and uses a wealth of economic data to illustrate the terrifying societal implications. <br>
						From health and education to finance and technology, his warning is start - all jobs that are on some level routine are like to eventually be automated, <br>
						resulting in the death of traditional careers and a hollowed-out middle class. <br>
						The robots are coming and we have to decide now whether the future will bring prosperity or catastrophe.<br><br><br>

						Among the seminal texts of the 20th century, Nineteen Eighty-Four is a rare work that grows more haunting as its futuristic purgatory becomes more real. Published in 1949, the book offers political satirist George Orwell's nightmarish vision of a totalitarian, bureaucratic world and one poor stiff's attempt to find individuality. The brilliance of the novel is Orwell's prescience of modern life--the ubiquity of television, the distortion of the language--and his ability to construct such a thorough version of hell. Required reading for students since it was published, it ranks among the most terrifying novels ever written.
